# Todo:
# - pause .act durring question asking, so that the user can answer the question and then continue with the next step.
# - add Wikipedia search functionallity
# - add better next_step handeling for example when current step is not correct
# - add ability for researcher to modefie the research plan, for example to add new steps or remove existing ones
# - add function to save final report with markdown into /final_report directory with date and time in the filename
